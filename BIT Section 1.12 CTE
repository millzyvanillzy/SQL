--Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
-- Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”. 

--This is the TEMPLATE for CTE
--

/*
WITH tempTable AS (
  SELECT
  EmployeeID, Jobtitle
  FROM employee_table
  WHERE LastName IN ('Smith','Jurup','Washington')
)
SELECT Jobtitle from tempTable 
*/
--Start by creating the SELECT
--SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity)
--FROM SpotifyData
--GROUP BY artist_name
--
-- NOW make the SELECT statement we just tested a CTE and implement it to solve the question

/*
WITH TopStar AS (
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) as Pop
FROM SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name AS TopStar , Pop FROM TopStar
WHERE Pop >= 90
*/

/*
TopStar           Pop
Doja Cat	         90.75
Ed Sheeran	95
Glass Animals	94
Harry Styles	90
Justin Bieber	90
Lil Nas X	90
MÃ¥neskin	90.5
Olivia Rodrigo	92.33333333333333
The Neighbourhood	92
The Weeknd	91.5

-- answer from instructor
-- 'Top Star' AS tag <-- This adds a new column and attaches a text value for each row that natches the criteria

/*
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
*/
