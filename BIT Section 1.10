  --1 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
  --2 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
  --3  What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
  --4 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
  --5 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
