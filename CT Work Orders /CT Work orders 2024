-- After pulling the last 12 months corrective work order list, I wanted to analyze the data and see if I could find some answers to questions related to CT work orders


-- Which CT devices had the highest number of work orders
SELECT CT_name, mfgr, model, count(WO) as WO_count
FROM CT_WO
GROUP BY CT_name
ORDER BY WO_count DESC
;


-- Which Mfgr of CT had the highest number of corrective work orders?

SELECT Mfgr, count(WO)
FROM CT_WO
GROUP BY Mfgr
ORDER BY count(WO) DESC
;
