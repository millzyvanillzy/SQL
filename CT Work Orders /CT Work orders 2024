-- After pulling the last 12 months corrective work order list, I wanted to analyze the data and see if I could find some answers to questions related to CT work orders


-- Which CT devices had the highest number of work orders
SELECT CT_name, mfgr, model, count(WO) as WO_count
FROM CT_WO
GROUP BY CT_name
ORDER BY WO_count DESC
;


-- Which Mfgr of CT had the highest number of corrective work orders?

SELECT Mfgr, count(WO)
FROM CT_WO
GROUP BY Mfgr
ORDER BY count(WO) DESC
;

-- What is missing from work order data is the age of the equipment, to add this in requires a LEFT JOIN through the "control number" from the work orders table to an inventory table

-- Goal is to combine the CT inventory and the work orders so we can see the age of the CT
-- Use a JOIN by the ControlNum aka CT_Name
SELECT w.ControlNum, w.EQ_type, w.Model, w.Mfgr, w.WO, i.age
FROM CT_WO w
JOIN CT_INVENTORY i
ON w.ControlNum = i.ControNum
GROUP BY WO
ORDER BY ControNum
;
