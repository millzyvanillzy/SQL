-- Assignment 2.10
-- Do each of the following at least once:

--    Group the data in a new way using a CASE statement.
--    Use a HAVING clause to determine something interesting about the data per category.
--    Use logical operators like AND or OR to filter the data in an interesting way.
--    Use an aggregate function like AVG, SUM, COUNT, MAX, and/or MIN to return summary statistics about the data.
    
-- Group the data in a new way using a CASE statement.
-- Group by industry by size

--SELECT industry , SUM(employees) as employee_total , 
--CASE
--WHEN SUM(employees) > 1000000 THEN 'huge'
--WHEN SUM(employees) > 5000000 THEN 'mid-sized'
--WHEN SUM(employees) > 10000 THEN 'compact'
--ELSE 'startup'
--END AS size
--FROM fortune_companies
--GROUP BY industry
--ORDER By employee_total DESC
--;


-- Which company has the fewest employees
--SELECT company_name, min(employees)
--FROM fortune_companies
--;

--    Use a HAVING clause to determine something interesting about the data per category.
-- Which companies have an average employee tenure that is at least 6 years
--SELECT company_name, avg(avg_employee_tenure) as average
--FROM fortune_companies
--GROUP BY company_name
--HAVING average > 6
--ORDER BY average DESC

--    Use logical operators like AND or OR to filter the data in an interesting way.
-- Show me the companies in the industries of Retail and Energy that have healthcare benefits
--SELECT company_name, industry, healthcare_benefits
--FROM fortune_companies
