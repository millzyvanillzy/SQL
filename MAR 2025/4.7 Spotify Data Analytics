-- This was my first project to take Spotify artist and track data in a CSV format and import the data as a table into SQLite, into an existing database.
-- I had to run a script to create the table layout:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

-- Next I imported the CSV file into SQLite into the newly created table and checked the result
-- Now that I had my data in place, I thought of some questions I wanted to answer by analyzing the data:

-- Show all of the Spotify data

--SELECT * 
--FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata


-- Show the artist name with the most tracks in the db
--SELECT
--artist_name 
--,count(track_ID) as count
--FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
--GROUP BY artist_name
--ORDER by count DESC
--LIMIT 1
--;
-- answer: Olivia Rodrigo with 4  <-- Not sure who this is. I think I'll add her to my next track to play irl.
-- Oh wow .. she has 47M monthly listeners. 



-- Let's group the tracks into 3 "buckets" for danceability
-- How should we group the tracks by danceability?
-- 0 to 0.5 is not very danceable
-- 0.5 to 0.6 is "somewhat danceable"
-- 0.6 to 1 is "quite danceable"
-- Write a SQL expression that shows the number of tracks by group
--SELECT
--track_name
--,danceability
--COUNT(track_ID) as Count
--,CASE
--    WHEN danceability >0.6 THEN 'quite danceable'
--    WHEN danceability >0.5 THEN 'somewhat danceable'
--    ELSE 'not very danceable' 
--END AS bucket
--FROM Spotifydata
--GROUP BY bucket
--ORDER BY Count DESC
--; 

--Answer:
--37	quite danceable
--8	somewhat danceable
--5	not very danceable
