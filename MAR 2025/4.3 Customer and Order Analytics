--Question #1
--How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
--Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs like we did in the "dealing with messy data" section of the previous lesson! 

--SELECT count(orderID)
--FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
--WHERE length(orderID)=6
--AND
--orderID<>"Null"
--;

--Question #2
-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

--SELECT COUNT(distinct orderid)
-- or
--SELECT orderID, Product
--FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
--WHERE length(orderid) = 6
--AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
--AND Product LIKE '%iph%'
; 
--Question #3
--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
-- Connect FebSales to customers by the orderID
--SELECT 
--distinct customers.acctnum
--,FebSales.orderID
--FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
--LEFT JOIN  BIT_DB.customers
--ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_ID
--WHERE length(orderID)=6
--AND orderid<>'Order ID'
--;

--Question #4
--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

--SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
--FROM JanSales
--ORDER BY price ASC
--LIMIT 3
--;

-- alternate
--SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
--FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
--WHERE price IN(Select min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
--;

--Question #5
-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
--(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products). 

--SELECT product, SUM(Quantity)*Price as totalRev
--FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
--WHERE product <> ''
--GROUP BY product
-- BY totalRev DESC
--;


--Question #6
--Which products were sold in February 
--at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
--how many of each were sold, 
--and what was the total revenue? 

--SELECT 
--orderID
--,Product
--,location
--,quantity
--,price
--,SUM(Quantity)*price as rev
--FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
--WHERE orderID NOT LIKE ''
--AND
--location LIKE '548 Lin%'
--GROUP BY product
--ORDER BY location
--;

--Question #7
--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February,
-- and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT
count(distinct CUST.acctnum) as count
--,orderID
--,count(orderID)
--,Product
--,Quantity
--,price
--,quantity*price
,AVG(quantity*price)as AvgOrder

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers CUST
ON FEB.orderID=CUST.order_ID

WHERE quantity>2
AND
orderID not like ''
AND orderid not like "Or%"
ORDER BY acctnum
;
